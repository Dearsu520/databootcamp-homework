# **Description** 

In this homework, I did the climate anaylsis and exploration in the climate.ipynb file based on the data provided in the Resources folder in the form of sqlite database. Two figures are generated in the climate anaylsis to illustrate the anaylsis visually. The figures are named as Perciptation_by_Date.png and Tempurature Frequency.png. For the climate app part of the homework, I constructed flask APIs in the file, main.py, for the serving climate data to the client side based on the data in the Resources folder in the form of sqlite database.
