# **Description** 

In this homework, I create a new database named as Employee_DB. To visualize and setup the creation of each table in this database, I create an ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) by using QuickDBD. From the ERD I create, I generate the Postgres SQL code the table generation. Then I upload each table with the same order as the tables are created from the data folder which contains all the data for this database. From there, I can query each table in this database to analysis the data and obtain the information I need. 

To test the valibilty of the data, I finish the bonus section of this homework to generate a visualization of the data by using jupyter notebook and SQLAlchemy. In this bonus section, I create a histogram to see the salary ranges for employees to see the common pattern. And based on the histogram, it can be observed that about 50% of employees' salaries falls in the cateogory of 40,000 to 50,000. 

The final submission of this homework contains:
1. An image of the ERD named as ERD.png,
2. An ERD script used to generate the ERD in QuickDBD named as ERD_script.txt,
3. A table creation sql file names as data_creation.sql, 
4. A query sql file for data analysis named as data_analysis_query.sql, 
5. A jupyter notebook that contains the visualization of the data named as bonus.ipynb.
6. An exported histogram figure from jupyter notebook names as Salary_Ranges_for_Employees_Histogram.png
