# **Description** 

For this homework, I used Tableau to aggregate the data for all New York Citi Bike Trips in 2020 and to generate corresponding visualizations, interactive maps, and dashboards as a yearly report. This report is used to analyze the New York Citi Bike program's behaviors for 2020 and illustrate the phenomena which could potentially help to improve the Citi Bike program.

The first phenomenon discovred is regarding the ridership changes throughout the year as displayed in the Riders Dashboard. As shown in the Monthly Ridership Growth in Percentage graph, the number of trips decreased from January to April, and then increased again. Same pattern can be applied to the monthly changes in user types and ridership genders as shown in the rest two graphs. This may be due to two factors, season and COVID-19. March and April are when COVID-19 arouse people's attention and started to widely spread in the U.S. This led to the decrease in number of trips. As the COVID-19 situation improved in the summer, number of trips increased again. 

Second phenomenon is regarding the usage of bikes as shown in the Bike Usage Dashbaord. According to the Bike Usage Chart, the averge trip duration and the total trip duration for each bike varies. It is clear that bikes were not evenly utitlized. Based on the total trip durations for each bike, the top 10 bikes due for inspection are displayed in the bubble chart. Bike ID 30627 is the one that are most likely due for inspection. 

The city officials requested two maps that displays all start and end bike stations on the map based on popularity. As shown in the maps, the popularity of stations varies between areas. The top 10 most popular start and end stations are displayed in the Bike Usage Dashboard as a reference. 

These are the phenomena and trends found based on the 2020 Citi Bike data regading the details of New York Citi Bike program. The details can be refered to my story and it can be used to publicize and improve the city program in the future.

# **Side Notes** 

All the visualizations, dashbaords, and stories are uploaded to my Tableau Public. This link will take you my [Tableau Public Directory](https://public.tableau.com/profile/yijing.su#!/).

Due to Tableau Public can only save maximum of 15,000,000 rows of data, the visualizations and dashbaords published on the Tableau Public will only display the data from January to September. The analysis applies to the entire 2020 data. To access my Tableau workbook of the full year data, this link will take you to my [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dw5Thtdi25bw4hPrnsNwFjpp3gTyfoF7/view?usp=sharing).
