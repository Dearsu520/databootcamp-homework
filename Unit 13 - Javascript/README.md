# **Description** 

For this homework, I created functionalities to render data into a html table using JavaScript and D3. The rendering method involves the use of event handlers and DOM tree manipulation. It involves filtering table items by specific attributes. The JavaScript script is in the static/js folder, and the file name is app.js.
