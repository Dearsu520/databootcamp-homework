Description: 
In this homework, I upload two folders named as "PyBank" and "PyRoll", which indicates the two parts of the homework. Inside each folder, there is a main.py file that contains my main python code for the corresponding analysis, and two folders. One folder is named as "Resources", which stores the csv file that I used to do my analysis. Another folder named as "Analysis" contains my output analysis results in text file.
