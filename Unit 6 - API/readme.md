# **Description** 

In this homework, I did the WeatherPy section of the homework. The source code file name is WeatherPy.ipynb. 
I created a python script to visualize the weather of ver 500 cities accross the world based on their coodinations. I used the OpenWeatherApp API python library to acquire the wheater information of these countries.

A detailed analysis is in begin of the WeatherPy.ipynb source code file. The three ovserved trends are described in this analysis.
