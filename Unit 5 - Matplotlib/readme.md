# **Description** 

In this homework, I analyzed the dataset of the tumor development for 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth  that were treated through a variety of drug regimens. The purpose of this experiment is to test the performance of one particular Pymaceuticals' treatment regimen, Capomulin, versus other regimens. A detailed data analysis is operated and the script written in jupyter notebook is uploaded inside the Pymaceuticals folder named as Pymaceuticals.ipynb. The three observations are concluded based on the analyzed results and they are written on the top of the Pymaceuticals.ipynb file.
