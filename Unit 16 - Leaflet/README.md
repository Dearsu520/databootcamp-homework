# **Description** 

For this homework, I created geo json visualizations for the earthquakes dataset using JavaScript and Leaflet. The rendering method involves the use of event handlers and DOM tree manipulation. It involves filtering sample data by specific subject ID. The JavaScript file is in the static/js folder, and the file name is logic.js.
