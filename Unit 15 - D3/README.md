# **Description** 

For this homework, I created data visualizations for the newspaper dataset using JavaScript and D3. The rendering method involves the use of event handlers and DOM tree manipulation. It involves filtering sample data by specific subject ID. The JavaScript file is in the static/js folder, and the file name is app.js.
