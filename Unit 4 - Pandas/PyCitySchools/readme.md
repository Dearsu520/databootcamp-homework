**Description:** 

In this homework, I chose the Option 2: PyCitySchools Homework and they are stored inside the PyCitySchools folder

Inside the PyCitySchools folder, I upload my pandas scripty written in jupyter notebook, named as PyCitySchools.ipynb. I also uplaod a screenshots folder which contains all the screenshots for the displayed Data Frame for each section of the Homework. The "Resources" stores the two csv files that I used to do my analysis. 

This link will take you to my [homework repository - Unit 4 Python](https://github.com/Dearsu520/databootcamp-homework/tree/master/Unit%204%20-%20Pandas/PyCitySchools).

The following is the final output Data Frame I got for each section of the homework.
